## Another approach (infinite plane)

    At grid creation, an origin node is created.
    All nodes:
        - store an XY offset relative to origin.
        - store pointers to their eight neighbours.

    Nodes are stored in dynamically resized arrays that can be accessed by:
        - using a hash algorythm, where the key is derived from XY coordinates.
        - iterated by using index

    Two arrays are used:
        - one for alive nodes
        - one for dead nodes

    Every tick:
        - check alive nodes if they should die
        - check dead nodes if they should live

    When an alive node is created:
        - Check alive nodes in every direction and add pointers to new node.
        - If a neighbouring node doesn't exist, create a dead node and add pointer to new node.

    When an alive node is destroyed
        - Check if neighbouring dead nodes still have neighbouring alive nodes.
          If not, clean up the dead node.

    When a dead node is created:
        - check if it neighbours to other dead and alive nodes, and add pointers


    NOTE: 
      1: This way we don't have to store all the dead nodes in a grid.
         Only the dead nodes neighbouring an alive node are stored.
      2: By not using 2D arrays, we can make an infinite grid


    When displaying grid:
        - place origin in middle
        - place nodes on display that fit within the boundaries of the display
